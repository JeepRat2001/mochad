mochad-0.1.2

    * Fix device name in log messages. CM19A was reported as CM15A.
    * Add install option that makes the controllers hot pluggable. udev in
    Ubunutu and hotplug2 in OpenWrt
    * Convert to use autoconf and automake.
    * Update mochad wiki pages with command and event reference. Also add
    instructions for building with OpenWrt.

mochad-0.1.3

    * Change the method for sending dim/bright commands so it matches AHP
    The new method uses 3 bytes instead of 2. This seems to work better
    with LM465 soft-start devices. xdim works much better and is easier to use
    but does not work with all lamp modules.
    * Add example client programs in Perl and bash.
    * Add --version command line parameter.
